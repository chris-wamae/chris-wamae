👋 Greetings, and welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is **Christopher Wamae Muraguri**, a professional **full-stack web developer** and hobbyist **game developer**.

♥️ I love working on projects that challenge me to improve my skills and, more importantly, leave a positive impact on people's lives.

📜 The main programming languages I use are **C#** through the **.NET** framework and **Unity**, as well as **JavaScript** with **React.js** or for web development without a framework.

👥 I am always looking to collaborate with fellow programmers and professionals like artists and designers, please feel free to get in touch with me. 

🥂 You can also reach out to me about something totally unrelated to programming, such as to have a heated debate on the true meaning of life!
