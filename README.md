Greetings and welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is **Christopher Wamae Muraguri**,a professional **full-stack web developer** and hobbyist **game developer**.

I love working on projects that challenge me to improve my skills and, more importantly, leave a positive impact on people's lives.

The main programming languages I use are **C#** through the **.NET** framework and **Unity**, as well as **JavaScript** with **React.js** or for web development without a framework.

I am always looking to collaborate with fellow programmers and professionals like artists and designers, so feel free to get in touch with me. 

You can also reach out to me about something totally unrelated to programming, such as to have a heated debate on the true meaning of life.
